# XATPSadPathTests

This repo provides the "Sad Path" test cases for XATP. The test cases can be found in `sad-path-tests.json`.

For convenience, an example test script in python is provided in `test.py`

To use in run `test.py -k <api_key> -u <verify_endpoint_url>`, where `api_key` and `verify_endpoint_url` are taken from the XATP VRS Endpoint to be tested.
